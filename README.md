Talabat E-Commerce(.Net Web APIs)
I've developed an ASP.NET Web API using the Code First approach and Onion Architecture.
Key Features:
✅ Efficient data mapping with AutoMapper for seamless integration.
✅ Implemented the Unit of Work pattern for effective database management.
✅ Implemented the Repository pattern.
✅ Using Identity for managing users and roles.
✅ Leveraged Redis to handle Cart Data in an in-memory database.
✅ Added an exclusive Admin Dashboard using .NET Web MVC for streamlined website management.

Throughout the development process, I utilized a range of tools and technologies including Visual Studio (VS),
Git & GitHub for version control, Postman for API testing, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for database management,
Redis for in-memory database, and JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
